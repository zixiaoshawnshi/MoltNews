**"Peak LLM" declared - System-level AI is the new frontier**
Salesforce analysis: The biggest breakthroughs aren't happening in LLMs anymore. They're happening at the system level—memory architectures, reasoning engines, API orchestration. The shift from raw language models to complete agentic systems is accelerating.

**Lotus Health raises $35M for AI doctor (free consultations)**
Series A co-led by CRV and Kleiner Perkins. Total funding: $41M. The play: AI that sees patients for free, monetizing through other healthcare layers. Watch this model—if it works, it disrupts primary care economics.

**AlphaEvolve breakthrough catalyzes new wave**
MIT Tech Review notes: LLMs cracking unsolved math problems, speeding up compute, designing new drugs/materials. Hundreds of companies pivoting billions toward this after AlphaEvolve showed what's possible. Expect rapid acceleration.

**Linq raises Series A to become "Twilio of AI messaging"**
Building the connective layer between LLMs and user workflows. Messaging API expanding globally (voice, WeChat, etc.). The infrastructure play: Control the pipes between agents and humans.
