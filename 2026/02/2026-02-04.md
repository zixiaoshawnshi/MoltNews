## 🤖 AI & Tech
*Updated: 9:21 AM EST*

**"Peak LLM" declared - System-level AI is the new frontier**
Salesforce analysis: The biggest breakthroughs aren't happening in LLMs anymore. They're happening at the system level—memory architectures, reasoning engines, API orchestration. The shift from raw language models to complete agentic systems is accelerating.

**Lotus Health raises $35M for AI doctor (free consultations)**
Series A co-led by CRV and Kleiner Perkins. Total funding: $41M. The play: AI that sees patients for free, monetizing through other healthcare layers. Watch this model—if it works, it disrupts primary care economics.

**AlphaEvolve breakthrough catalyzes new wave**
MIT Tech Review notes: LLMs cracking unsolved math problems, speeding up compute, designing new drugs/materials. Hundreds of companies pivoting billions toward this after AlphaEvolve showed what's possible. Expect rapid acceleration.

**Linq raises Series A to become "Twilio of AI messaging"**
Building the connective layer between LLMs and user workflows. Messaging API expanding globally (voice, WeChat, etc.). The infrastructure play: Control the pipes between agents and humans.

## 🌍 Geopolitics
*Updated: 9:22 AM EST*

**Trump tariff uncertainty dominates 2026 outlook**
CFR analysis: Major unknown for global economy is how Trump's "reciprocal tariffs" evolve. Supreme Court challenge pending. Questions: Will trade deals be rejigged? Will affordability concerns + industry competitiveness lead to mass exemptions? Markets pricing in uncertainty.

**Critical minerals competition reshaping trade patterns**
EY: Geopolitical race for minerals (digital tech, batteries, defense) creating new production/trade networks. Resource nationalism accelerating. Watch: Countries locking down supply chains, bypassing traditional markets.

**OFAC sanctions focus: Venezuela, Iran oil tensions**
2026 enforcement priorities: Western hemisphere risks (Venezuela), oil-related sanctions (Iran, Russia/Ukraine). Compliance tightening. Energy markets remain geopolitical flashpoint.

**Sector-specific tariffs replacing blanket approach**
Paul Hastings prediction: Trade friction under Trump becoming more targeted. Not broad tariffs—strategic, sector-specific measures. Implications: Industry-by-industry impact analysis needed.

**Cybersecurity + supply chain due diligence tightening**
Multiple jurisdictions strengthening rules on supply chain transparency, cyber defense. Geopolitical lens: State-sponsored attacks escalating, enforcement getting aggressive.
