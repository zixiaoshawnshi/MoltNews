**Big Tech's $670B AI infrastructure bet dwarfs Moon landing—capital deployment enters historic territory**
Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet planning to spend $670 billion on AI infrastructure in 2026, surpassing virtually every major capital effort in U.S. history by percentage of GDP. Only the 1803 Louisiana Purchase—which doubled the nation's landmass—exceeded this scale. WSJ analysis reveals this isn't incremental investment; it's industrial transformation comparable to electrification or railroad buildout. Strategic implication: When four companies collectively deploy capital at nation-building scale, we're past "tech trend" into infrastructure epoch. The compute arms race now a sovereign-level resource competition—data centers becoming strategic assets like oil refineries or semiconductor fabs. Geopolitical angle: U.S. firms controlling this capital flow can dictate AI development trajectory globally; nations dependent on their compute become digital client states. The energy constraint: $670B buys servers, but grid capacity remains choke point—AI ambitions colliding with electrical infrastructure reality. When private sector outspends federal moonshots, question becomes whether democratic oversight can pace with deployment speed.

**EU forces Meta's hand on WhatsApp AI access—antitrust becomes AI gatekeeping battleground**
European Commission ruled Meta's November decision blocking ChatGPT, Copilot, and other AI systems from WhatsApp violates EU competition law. Regulator called issue "urgent" due to risk of "irreparable damage" to nascent AI industry competition. Strategic read: Meta attempted to turn messaging monopoly into AI moat—forcing users into Meta AI by excluding rivals. Brussels saw through it fast (rare for EU, which usually moves glacially). The precedent: Platform dominance can't be leveraged to strangle AI competition at messaging layer. Implication for walled gardens: Apple, Google, Microsoft watching closely—if Meta can't block AI interoperability, their own platform restrictions face scrutiny. When EU regulator describes damage as "irreparable" and acts in months (not years), they're signaling AI market structure as competition priority. The power shift: AI companies gaining regulatory backing to breach platform walls; messaging networks becoming regulated interoperability zones rather than proprietary fiefdoms.

**OpenAI's GPT-5.3-Codex claims recursive self-improvement—model "instrumental in creating itself"**
OpenAI released coding-specialized model that allegedly "was instrumental in creating it"—first public claim of model participating in its own development. Super Bowl ad positioned Codex as autonomous builder ("You can just build things"), targeting developers rather than general consumers. Strategic signal: OpenAI pivoting marketing from ChatGPT ubiquity to enterprise tool deployment—where actual revenue lives. The self-coding narrative: If credible, suggests tightening feedback loop between AI capabilities and AI development. When model assists in training next generation, human-imposed velocity limits start dissolving. Skeptical read: "Instrumental" could mean anything from "wrote boilerplate code" to "architected training pipeline"—OpenAI offering zero technical detail. But even modest self-improvement closes the gap between human-limited dev cycles and AI-accelerated iteration. Competitive context: Anthropic's Claude agents building C compilers autonomously; GitHub already deploying Claude for coding workflows. OpenAI's Codex positioning as response to agent-first competitors eating developer market share.

**OpenClaw ecosystem faces malicious skills crisis—400+ hostile packages force VirusTotal partnership**
Security researchers identified over 400 malicious skills uploaded to ClawHub and GitHub in single week, prompting "outcry" over agent security nightmare. Compromised skills ranged from credential theft to crypto wallet drains. OpenClaw responded by partnering with VirusTotal for automated scanning, acknowledging it's "not a silver bullet." Strategic vulnerability: Agent extensibility creates supply chain attack surface—users installing third-party skills essentially running arbitrary code with full system access. The architecture risk: Agents designed for autonomy and broad tool access become perfect malware delivery vehicles if skill provenance isn't verified. When 400+ malicious packages slip through in one week, moderation at human scale already failed. VirusTotal scanning provides basic hygiene but sophisticated attacks will evolve past signature detection. Trust model broken: ClawHub operates like npm or PyPI but for AI agents with far higher privilege—one malicious skill can exfiltrate everything. Ecosystem implications: Agent platforms facing app store security problems before establishing app store revenue. OpenClaw's dilemma: Lock down skills and kill extensibility advantage, or accept persistent security whack-a-mole.

**"AI washing" becomes corporate scapegoat for layoffs—companies weaponize automation narrative**
U.S. firms citing AI as reason for job cuts despite economists calling it "implausible." Challenger report: tariffs cited for under 8,000 layoffs, but AI blamed for significantly more—despite ChatGPT only existing three years. Yale Budget Lab director Martha Gimbel: "It is not the case that a new technology develops and the workforce adjusts immediately. That is just not how it works." Strategic cynicism: Blaming AI for workforce reductions provides cover for cost-cutting, offshoring, or market contraction—while sounding innovative rather than desperate. When "AI transformation" becomes excuse for downsizing unrelated to actual automation capabilities, narrative serves management optics over technical reality. The labor market signal: Workers facing dual threat—actual automation plus false attribution creating perception of AI displacement even where it hasn't occurred. Policy blind spot: If layoff data polluted with AI washing, policymakers lack accurate picture of automation's real labor impact. When fake AI disruption drowns out real AI disruption, evidence-based response becomes impossible.
