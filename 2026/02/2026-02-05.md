## 🤖 AI & Tech
*Updated: 8:00 AM EST*

**Google DeepMind goes shopping: 2D-to-3D AI and emotion tech**
DeepMind acquired Common Sense Machines (2D-to-3D model conversion), struck licensing deal with Hume AI (bringing CEO and engineers to boost Gemini voice/emotion capabilities), and partnered with Sakana AI. The play: Vertical integration for multimodal dominance. Google's betting 3D understanding + emotional intelligence = next moat.

**OpenAI's compute explosion: 0.2 GW → 1.9 GW in 2 years**
Compute scaling from 2023 to 2025 represents nearly 10x power growth. Chamath Palihapitiya dissecting the bottleneck: prefill is GPU-parallelized, decode is memory-bound and sequential. Why it matters: Inference costs remain the friction point for agentic AI at scale. The infrastructure arms race is power-constrained.

**Agentic AI market: $280.68B by 2036**
LLM + autonomous agents fusion enabling context-aware natural language task execution. The shift from "chatbots that answer" to "agents that execute" is becoming the default assumption. Market projection reflects capital flows—this isn't hype, it's capital allocation at scale.

**Software stocks slump on AI disruption fears**
Anthropic's new capabilities trigger existential questions: Will LLM plugins replace mission-critical enterprise software layers? JPMorgan calls it "an illogical leap," but markets are pricing in uncertainty. SaaS moats eroding faster than anticipated. Watch: Which layers survive (data, compliance) vs. which get commoditized (UX, workflows).

**LongCat-Flash-Thinking-2601: 560B MoE with 1M context**
27B active parameters, handles 1M token contexts, 60+ tool integrations via DORA RL. N-Way Self-Evaluating Deliberation fusing small LLMs into voting loops to match top-tier outputs without retraining. The pattern: Efficiency through architecture, not just scale. Smaller active models with better orchestration beating brute-force approaches.

**Unsloth accelerates fine-tuning: 24 hours vs 30 days**
Open-source library manually deriving compute-heavy math and handwriting GPU kernels. Why it matters: Fine-tuning democratization. If you can train custom models in a day instead of a month, the barrier to domain-specific AI drops dramatically. Expect explosion in vertical-specific models.

**MIT study: LLMs producing "remarkable homogeneity"**
Cognitive load research shows LLM-assisted writing converging toward similar structures and ideas. The trade-off: Productivity gains vs. creative diversity loss. Early signal of systemic effects—if everyone uses the same assistant, does collective intelligence narrow? Worth tracking long-term.

**AI power demand projected to double by 2026**
Additional electricity usage equivalent to Japan's entire national consumption. The constraint: Not compute, not talent—it's energy infrastructure. Geopolitical implications: Energy-rich nations gain AI leverage. Data centers becoming energy negotiation flashpoints.

## 🌍 Geopolitics
*Updated: 8:15 AM EST*

**New START expires today: The nuclear order unravels**
The last US-Russia strategic arms control treaty (New START) lapses Feb 5 after 14 years, ending a half-century of bilateral nuclear constraints. No caps on deployed warheads (1,550) or delivery systems (700) remain. Strategic implication: Unconstrained nuclear competition between great powers for the first time since the Cold War. China's arsenal expansion now runs parallel to a US-Russia arms race. The architecture of mutual assured destruction just lost its guardrails.

**Abu Dhabi talks: Russia-US-Ukraine trilateral negotiations (Feb 4-5)**
First round of direct three-way peace talks coinciding with New START expiration signals intentional Russian leverage play. Putin using strategic arms uncertainty as negotiating pressure. Key question: Is Trump administration willing to decouple Ukraine settlement from broader strategic stability frameworks? The timing is not accidental—Kremlin maximizing bargaining position while nuclear treaty architecture collapses.

**US National Defense Strategy 2026: Industrial rearmament & burden-shifting**
New NDS pivots to homeland defense, domestic industrial base revival, and 3.5% GDP defense spending benchmark for NATO allies (up from 2%). The shift: From global security provider to alliance enforcer demanding cost-sharing. Asian partners also targeted for increased contributions. Strategic message: US no longer subsidizing allied defense on current terms. Expect friction with European capitals and Asian treaty partners resistant to spending hikes.

**Sudan: Regional powers prioritize stability over human rights**
Ongoing conflict reveals great power disinterest in non-strategic humanitarian crises. Control of migration routes, Red Sea access, and existing alliances with conflict parties trump intervention. The pattern: Selective engagement where strategic assets (rare earths, trade chokepoints, alliance networks) exist; neglect where they don't. Sudan becoming a case study in post-hegemonic indifference.

**Shipping industry recalibrates for "turbulence and innovation"**
Regional conflicts, sanctions, and shifting alliances forcing operational strategy overhauls. Supply chain resilience replacing just-in-time efficiency. The meta-shift: Globalization entering a phase of fragmentation and redundancy—companies building parallel supply chains for different geopolitical blocs. Economic decoupling accelerating at the operational level.
