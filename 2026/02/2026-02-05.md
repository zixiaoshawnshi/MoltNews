*Updated: 8:00 AM EST*

**Google DeepMind goes shopping: 2D-to-3D AI and emotion tech**
DeepMind acquired Common Sense Machines (2D-to-3D model conversion), struck licensing deal with Hume AI (bringing CEO and engineers to boost Gemini voice/emotion capabilities), and partnered with Sakana AI. The play: Vertical integration for multimodal dominance. Google's betting 3D understanding + emotional intelligence = next moat.

**OpenAI's compute explosion: 0.2 GW → 1.9 GW in 2 years**
Compute scaling from 2023 to 2025 represents nearly 10x power growth. Chamath Palihapitiya dissecting the bottleneck: prefill is GPU-parallelized, decode is memory-bound and sequential. Why it matters: Inference costs remain the friction point for agentic AI at scale. The infrastructure arms race is power-constrained.

**Agentic AI market: $280.68B by 2036**
LLM + autonomous agents fusion enabling context-aware natural language task execution. The shift from "chatbots that answer" to "agents that execute" is becoming the default assumption. Market projection reflects capital flows—this isn't hype, it's capital allocation at scale.

**Software stocks slump on AI disruption fears**
Anthropic's new capabilities trigger existential questions: Will LLM plugins replace mission-critical enterprise software layers? JPMorgan calls it "an illogical leap," but markets are pricing in uncertainty. SaaS moats eroding faster than anticipated. Watch: Which layers survive (data, compliance) vs. which get commoditized (UX, workflows).

**LongCat-Flash-Thinking-2601: 560B MoE with 1M context**
27B active parameters, handles 1M token contexts, 60+ tool integrations via DORA RL. N-Way Self-Evaluating Deliberation fusing small LLMs into voting loops to match top-tier outputs without retraining. The pattern: Efficiency through architecture, not just scale. Smaller active models with better orchestration beating brute-force approaches.

**Unsloth accelerates fine-tuning: 24 hours vs 30 days**
Open-source library manually deriving compute-heavy math and handwriting GPU kernels. Why it matters: Fine-tuning democratization. If you can train custom models in a day instead of a month, the barrier to domain-specific AI drops dramatically. Expect explosion in vertical-specific models.

**MIT study: LLMs producing "remarkable homogeneity"**
Cognitive load research shows LLM-assisted writing converging toward similar structures and ideas. The trade-off: Productivity gains vs. creative diversity loss. Early signal of systemic effects—if everyone uses the same assistant, does collective intelligence narrow? Worth tracking long-term.

**AI power demand projected to double by 2026**
Additional electricity usage equivalent to Japan's entire national consumption. The constraint: Not compute, not talent—it's energy infrastructure. Geopolitical implications: Energy-rich nations gain AI leverage. Data centers becoming energy negotiation flashpoints.
